# Crowd Density Estimation
This project is under development, if you have any issue feel free to post it.
## Objective
In this project I will build an system using Deep Learning that can approximate the number of people in a surveillance camera.

## Data Set
This project is using PETS as training and testing data set

## Dependency
To successfully run the code, you need to have the following dependencies:

1. Python 3.5

2. Numpy 1.11

3. Tensorflow


## Usage

1. Clone this repo.

2. Download the PETS 2009 data set from http://www.cvg.reading.ac.uk/PETS2009/a.html#s0

3. Extract the data set and move the Crowd_PETS09 folder under the parent directory of the repo(repo and data set must be under a same directory)

4. Label the image on your own in a label.csv file. Then put your csv file together with your training set image file.

5. Modify the corresponding parameters(e.g. file_path and label_path)

6. Here you go
